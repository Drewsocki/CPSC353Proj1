Name: Andrew Wysocki

Description: There are four separate files in this repository, main.py(our python file), text.txt(a sample text file), gorvachev.jpg(an example image file), and output.png(another example image file). main.py has four functions in it encoder(), decoder(), str_bits(), bits_str(). What command you run decided what functions are run.

Instructions: There are two ways to run the program based on what you want to do. 
For Encoding text into an image you use the command:
  python.exe main.py encode 'you_text_file' 'your_jpg_file' 
and to decode an image you run: 
  python.exe main.py decode 'your_png_file'.
